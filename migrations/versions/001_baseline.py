"""Baseline migration for ServeoPOS beta

Revision ID: 001_baseline
Revises: 
Create Date: 2025-12-04 13:00:00.000000

This migration represents the consolidated baseline for the v0.1.0-beta release.
It is intentionally empty because the database for existing deployments should be
created from the current models (or created by an initial schema generation),
then Alembic can be stamped to this revision.
