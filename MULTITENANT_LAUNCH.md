# Multi-Tenant Restaurant POS - Beta SaaS Launch Summary

## Overview
ServeoPOS is now positioned as a **free beta SaaS platform** for restaurant POS management with multi-tenant architecture supporting:
- **Platform Owner**: Super admin (owns the entire SaaS platform)
- **Restaurant Admins**: Independent restaurant operators (manage their own restaurants)
- **Staff**: Kitchen, waiters, managers (work within assigned restaurants)

---

## Architecture Changes

### Database Models (models.py)

#### User Model (Enhanced)
```python
- restaurant_id (FK to Restaurant, nullable for super_admin)
- is_super_admin (Boolean) - True only for platform owner
- role (String) - super_admin, restaurant_admin, manager, waiter, kitchen
- created_at (DateTime)
- restaurant (relationship)
```

#### Restaurant Model (New)
```python
- id (PK)
- name, email, phone
- address, city, country, postal_code
- owner_id (FK to User) - restaurant_admin user
- active (Boolean)
- created_at, updated_at
- owner (relationship to User)
- staff (relationship to Users - all users in this restaurant)
```

#### StoreSettings Model (New)
```python
- restaurant_id (FK to Restaurant, unique)
- timezone (e.g., 'Europe/Dublin', 'America/New_York')
- locale (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'pt', 'hi')
- currency (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', 'INR')
- tax_region (e.g., 'EU', 'US-CA', 'IN')
- address_format (standard, european, asian)
- business_registration, vat_number
- payment_terms (days)
- invoice_prefix (e.g., 'INV')
- created_at, updated_at
- restaurant (relationship)
```

### Migrations

**Migration 005: `005_add_tax_rules.py`**
- Creates `tax_rule` table for region-based tax configuration

**Migration 006: `006_add_restaurant_store_settings.py`**
- Creates `restaurant` table with owner_id FK to user.id
- Creates `store_settings` table with restaurant_id FK (unique)
- Adds user.restaurant_id, user.is_super_admin, user.created_at columns

## Access Control

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin** (`is_super_admin=True, role='super_admin'`)
   - Platform owner
   - Can create/manage restaurants
   - Can manage all users, see all data
   - `restaurant_id = None`

2. **Restaurant Admin** (`role='restaurant_admin'`)
   - Assigned to specific restaurant (`restaurant_id` set)
   - Can manage their restaurant details and staff
   - Can update store settings
   - Cannot see other restaurants' data

3. **Staff** (manager, waiter, kitchen)
   - Assigned to specific restaurant
   - Limited permissions based on role

### Authorization Pattern
```python
# Super admin sees all
if current_user.is_super_admin:
    # Access all restaurants

# Restaurant admin sees own only
elif current_user.role == 'restaurant_admin':
    # Check current_user.id == restaurant.owner_id

# Staff cannot manage restaurants/settings
else:
    return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 403
```

## Code Highlights

### Admin Endpoints Integration
```python
# Check super admin vs restaurant admin access
@admin_bp.route('/api/restaurants', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def api_list_restaurants():
    if current_user.is_super_admin:
        restaurants = Restaurant.query.all()
    elif current_user.role == 'restaurant_admin':
        restaurants = Restaurant.query.filter_by(owner_id=current_user.id).all()
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 403
```

### Relationship Resolution
```python
# Fixed SQLAlchemy ambiguity by specifying foreign_keys
restaurant = db.relationship('Restaurant', 
                             foreign_keys=[restaurant_id], 
                             backref='staff')
owner = db.relationship('User', 
                        foreign_keys=[owner_id], 
                        backref='restaurants_owned')
```
